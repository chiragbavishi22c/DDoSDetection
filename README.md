# DDoS attack detection using Deep Learning

The project aims to leverage the power of deep learning algorithms to analyze network traffic patterns and identify anomalous behavior associated with DDoS attacks. The project will involve collecting and pre-processing a large dataset of network traffic, designing and training a deep learning model, and evaluating the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision and recall.
